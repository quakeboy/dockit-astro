Hey there, I'm Rajavanya Subramaniyan and I live in 🇷🇪 Reunion Island (France 🇫🇷) - dad of a 2-year-old. It's beautiful here but quiet, so really happy to meet you here through this about page.

#### Relevant Career Timeline
---
###### First decade: game dev
- Started at 18 with Flash 5, moved to iOS game dev. Shipped some titles that hit top 10 worldwide. At 24, led a 15-person game dev services team after our company raised from IDG & Sequoia. Moved to Bangkok to make match-3 games published by Rovio at the time.
 
###### The shift
- Somewhere along the way, life kicked me in the face and I woke up to the world of product/marketing. Also got disillusioned when I realized the match-3 games we were making were just reskinned slot machines - and even the players didn't seem to care when I pointed this out 😆
- Met people, read books that opened my eyes to the human side. Started tinkering with marketing in my off-hours. Eventually quit to figure it out properly.
 
###### Second decade: marketing
- Freelanced on Upwork - was top-rated, learned by doing - CRO, copywriting, email automation, inbound.
- Traveled SE Asia and South America as a digital nomad pre-covid.
- Worked with KodeKloud through early growth ($8K → $130K MRR), helping transition marketing away from the founder, my friend.

Now focused on developer tools and platforms. The dev background gives me a weird angle on how devs actually evaluate tools. Fan of opinionated frameworks and products that respect my time. Love almost everything PostHog does except their website layout (active as of early 2026) , lol.

I've been extremely fortunate to have been able to visit / live in multiple countries. I've learnt timeless lessons about culture, understanding people and myself.
