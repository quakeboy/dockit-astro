      ## How do you fix these? 
      It's not more campaigns. <br /> It's not hiring
      another marketing expert. <br /> <br /> It's someone embedded with your
      team who can see the patterns you're missing, help you make the right
      strategic bets, and actually lead the work while you focus on what you do
      best.

<Section title="Marketing Strategy & Leadership for Dev-Tools
<span class='light-text'>With A Fractional Engagement</span>">
<NarrowText>

I don't sit on the sidelines. I work inside your company, embedded with your team.
That means I'm holding standups with our team. I'm working directly with our team on the campaigns that matter. I'm helping you make the strategic calls in real-time, not reviewing decisions after they're made.
You get a fractional leader who thinks about your long-term marketing strategy while actually leading the execution. The strategy and the leadership come together.

#### What that looks like:

- Quarterly strategy sessions and reviews where we look at what's moving the needle (and what isn't)
- I hire and build the team for our company.
- Weekly / Fortnightly check-ins with the rest of the leadership team to report progress
- I'm holding standups with our team, understanding what's happening frequently
- I'm the Slack channels embedded with our team participating in conversations as needed
- When a campaign needs to pivot mid-quarter, we adjust together
- Your team knows what the strategy is because I'm explaining it while we're building it, not after

This is different from hiring a consultant who audits your work. Different from hiring a full-time marketing leader. It's fractional leadership. Strategic direction and leading execution, at a cadence that makes the team

<Testimonial 
  name="Mumshad Mannambeth" 
  title="Founder & CEO at KodeKloud"
>
  “I had a lot of issues handling the operations and marketing side of my
  business. There was nobody to lead marketing activities, we didn’t have a
  marketing strategy in place. I had to do everything from product to platform
  to marketing by myself. And I couldn’t focus on any of these fully. I needed
  someone to take over the website and marketing side of things and lead it,
  build marketing strategy, run campaigns and monitor results 
  
  ... 
  
  Our
  work together helped me focus on our courses which is an important aspect of
  our platform, as well as growing our team. Raj is a smart and talented
  marketer with good leadership skills, knowledge of modern technology and
  tools, and great communication skills. His ability to research and identify
  the right solutions, setup automation and lead a team of developers helped us
  build a new learning platform from scratch and provide our users with a better
  experience..”

<Accordion
  question="What Is A Fractional Marketing Strategist + Leader?"
  type="basic">
A Fractional Marketing Leader is a marketing executive serving businesses by leading marketing strategy, sales development, growth opportunities, and heading the marketing department. 

Businesses use fractional C-level services because they do not need a full-time C-level executive but still require expert strategy and leadership. Businesses enjoy the flexibility that a fractional executive provides. 

Often, it makes sense to bring in a fractional chief marketing officer as opposed to full-time. This can be for financial reasons, as a typical full-time CMO salary can cost more than $200,000 per year. It could also be because the work needed to be done by the CMO does not require a full-time position.

<Accordion
  question="What Are Their Responsibilities?"
  type="basic">
- Developing the marketing strategy for both the short-term and long-term.
- Deciding and committing to which marketing strategies are best for your business, such as SEO, content marketing, paid advertising, or events/conferences, etc.
- Solving marketing problems that will arise and need to be resolved quickly.
- Leading the marketing department and inspiring team members.
- Hiring new employees and building out your team for success.
- Working with outsourced agencies leaning on their experience.

Your Fractional CMO should have a wealth of marketing and managerial experience. Therefore, the Fractional CMO should be the natural leader of the marketing team.

In addition to leadership qualities, the Fractional CMO is to be seen as the c-suite level marketing strategist who helps organizations achieve their marketing goals. Your Fractional CMO will work closely with both your organization’s leadership team and the marketing talent executing the marketing tactics on a day-to-day basis.
